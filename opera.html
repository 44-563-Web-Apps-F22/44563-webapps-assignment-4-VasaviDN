    <P>
        OPENING CHORUS.

        <p>In lazy languor—motionless,<br>
        We lie and dream of nothingness;<br>
        For visions come<br>
        From Poppydom<br>
        Direct at our command:<br>
        Or, delicate alternative,<br>
        In open idleness we live,<br>
        With lyre and lute<br>
        And silver flute,<br>
        The life of Lazyland.</p>
        
        <p>SOLO - Phylla.</p>
        
        <p>The song of birds<br>
        In ivied towers;<br>
        The rippling play<br>
        Of waterway;<br>
        The lowing herds;<br>
        The breath of flowers;<br>
        The languid loves<br>
        Of turtle doves—<br>
        These simple joys are all at hand<br>
        Upon thy shores, O Lazyland!</p>
        
        <p>(Enter Calynx)</p>
        
        <p>Calynx: Good news! Great news! His Majesty's eldest daughter,
        Princess Zara, who left our shores five years since to go to
        England—the greatest, the most powerful, the wisest country
        in the world—has taken a high degree at Girton, and is on
        her way home again, having achieved a complete mastery over all
        the elements that have tended to raise that glorious country to
        her present preeminent position among civilized nations!</p>
        
        <p>Salata: Then in a few months Utopia may hope to be completely
        Anglicized?</p>
        
        <p>Calynx: Absolutely and without a doubt.</p>
        
        <p>Melene: (lazily) We are very well as we are. Life without a
        care—every want supplied by a kind and fatherly monarch,
        who, despot though he be, has no other thought than to make his
        people happy—what have we to gain by the great change that
        is in store for us?</p>
        
        <p>Salata: What have we to gain? English institutions, English
        tastes, and oh, English fashions!</p>
            
        <p>Calynx: England has made herself what she is because, in that
        favored land, every one has to think for himself. Here we have
        no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all our wants,
        and our political opinions are formed for us by the journals to
        which we subscribe. Oh, think how much more brilliant this
        dialogue would have been, if we had been accustomed to exercise
        our reflective powers! They say that in England the conversation
        of the very meanest is a coruscation of impromptu epigram!</p>
       
        <p>(Enter Tarara in a great rage)</p>
        
        <p>Tarara: Lalabalele talala! Callabale lalabalica falahle!</p>

        <p>Calynx: (horrified) Stop—stop, I beg! (All the ladies
        close their ears.)</p>
        
        <p>Tarara: Callamalala galalate! Caritalla lalabalee kallalale
        poo!</p>
        
        <p>Ladies: Oh, stop him! stop him!</p>
        
        <p>Calynx: My lord, I'm surprised at you. Are you not aware that
        His Majesty, in his despotic acquiescence with the emphatic wish
        of his people, has ordered that the Utopian language shall be
        banished from his court, and that all communications shall
        henceforward be made in the English tongue?</p>
        
         <p>Tarara: Yes, I'm perfectly aware of it, although—(suddenly
        presenting an explosive "cracker"). Stop—allow me.</p>
        
        <p>Calynx: (pulls it). Now, what's that for?</p>
        
        <p>Tarara: Why, I've recently been appointed Public Exploder to His
        Majesty, and as I'm constitutionally nervous, I must accustom
        myself by degrees to the startling nature of my duties. Thank you.
        I was about to say that although, as Public Exploder, I am next in
        succession to the throne, I nevertheless do my best to fall in
        with the royal decree. But when I am overmastered by an indignant
        sense of overwhelming wrong, as I am now, I slip into my native
        tongue without knowing it. I am told that in the language of that
        great and pure nation, strong expressions do not exist, consequently
        when I want to let off steam I have no alternative but to
        say, "Lalabalele molola lililah kallalale poo!"</p>
