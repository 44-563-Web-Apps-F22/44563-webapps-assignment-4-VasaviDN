        <h3 class="Scaphio"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Scaphio</h3><p class="speech"> My poor boy, I see it all.</p>

        <h3 class="Phantis"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Phantis</h3><p class="speech">Oh! Scaphio, she is so beautiful.  Ah! you smile, for
        you have never seen her.  She sailed for England three months
        before you took office.</p>

        <h3 class="Scaphio"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Scaphio</h3><p class="speech">Now tell me, is your affection requited?</p>

        <h3 class="Phantis"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Phantis</h3><p class="speech">I do not knowâ€”I am not sure.  Sometimes I think it
        is, and then come these torturing doubts!  I feel sure that she
        does not regard me with absolute indifference, for she could never
        look at me without having to go to bed with a sick headache.</p>

        <h3 class="Scaphio"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Scaphio</h3><p class="speech">That is surely something.  Come, take heart, boy!  you
        are young and beautiful.  What more could maiden want?</p>

        <h3 class="Phantis"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Phantis</h3><p class="speech">Ah! Scaphio, remember she returns from a land where
        every youth is as a young Greek god, and where such beauty as I
        can boast is seen at every turn.</p>

        <h3 class="Scaphio"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Scaphio</h3><p class="speech">Be of good cheer!  Marry her, boy, if so your fancy
        wills, and be sure that love will come.</p> 

        <h3 class="Phantis"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Phantis</h3><p class="speech">(overjoyed)  Then you will assist me in this?</p>

        <h3 class="Scaphio"><i class="fa fa-male"></i>Scaphio</h3><p class="speech">Why, surely!  Silly one, what have you to fear?  We have
        but to say the word, and her father must consent.  Is he not our
        very slave?  Come, take heart.  I cannot bear to see you sad.</p>
